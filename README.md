# Welcome!
Toudles here! Still somewhat of a beginner coder with the goal of creating my own games/working on big projects with companies I love ^-^

# What I'm doing currently
- Learning Java.

# To-do list
- Learn C++ and how to create games with it on Unreal Engine.
- Create games via pygames.
- Relearn/practice web development via html, css, javascript. (main goal is to create a website)
- Expand first discord bot to more than just the default rock paper scissors.

# Personal Projects

- [Snake](https://github.com/Toudles/Snake) using python
    - Description --> [W.I.P] A simplified version of an old-time favorite game, Snake.
